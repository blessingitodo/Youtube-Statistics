# Youtube Statistics

As we learn more SQL and gain more experience, let's keep working with more than one table. YouTube contains tons of data, and it's always easy to ask questions about it. For example, these datasets have data about almost 2,000 YouTube videos and comments, such as the number of views and likes. We can use this to answer some basic questions:

* What are the most commented-upon videos? Or the most liked?
* How many total views does each category have? How many likes?
* What are the most-liked comments?
* What is the ratio of views/likes per video? Per each category?
* But what will really expand your understanding of SQL is answering more elaborate questions:
* What is the average sentiment score in each keyword category?
* How many times do company names (i.e., Apple or Samsung) appear in each keyword category?
